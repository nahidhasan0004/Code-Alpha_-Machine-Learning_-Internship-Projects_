## **Projects Overview**
### **1. Credit Scoring Model**
This project focuses on building a data-driven credit scoring system that applies multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and accurately estimate the probability of loan default.

### **2. Emotion Recognition From Speech**
In this project, I developed a speech emotion recognition system that leverages machine learning algorithms to classify emotional states from extracted audio features. The model demonstrates potential use in emotion-aware systems for customer service and mental health assessment.

### **3. Disease Prediction From Medical Data**
In this project, I developed a predictive model that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze medical datasets for disease prediction. The approach aims to enhance early detection and improve decision-making in healthcare.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Various machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
## **License**
